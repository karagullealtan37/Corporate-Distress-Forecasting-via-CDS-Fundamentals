# Project Proposal

**Title:** *Event-Driven Risk Prediction in AI and Semiconductor Stocks Using Regression and Machine Learning*

I propose to study how geopolitical and regulatory shocks influence the returns and volatility of AI and semiconductor companies using statistical learning and event analysis. The project focuses on understanding the drivers of risk for key firms in the AI infrastructure ecosystem—such as **NVIDIA**, **AMD**, **TSMC**, **ASML**, **Microsoft**, and **Google**—through data-driven modeling.  

Using daily market data, I will construct rolling volatility, drawdown, and trading activity features. Several predictive models—**linear** and **LASSO regression** for volatility, and **logistic classification** for “stress-day” detection—will be trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics (**R²**, **accuracy**, **ROC-AUC**). In addition, I will implement a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** regression to test whether major geopolitical events (such as U.S.–China export restrictions or Taiwan-related tensions) produce significant abnormal returns in AI-related stocks compared to broader technology peers.  

The final analysis will provide insights into how political and supply chain risks shape the short-term dynamics of AI-driven equities, highlighting which events and features have the strongest influence on market behavior.
